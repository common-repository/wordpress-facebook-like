It was officially released on the <a href="http://blog.gunnjerkens.com/2010/04/facebook-like-plugin-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">GunnJerkens blog</a>.</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do you adjust the settings =

After activating the plugin a new menu item will be added under Settings labeled 'Facebook-Like'

= Why is there so much whitespace under the like button =

Facebook reserves space so that it can show faces of other people who liked the content as well. If you disable show faces in the settings it will get rid of that space.
